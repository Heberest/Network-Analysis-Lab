# Network Analysis Lab

## Objective

Analyze and determine whether a detected internal network activity, specifically ‘Local to Local Port Scanning,’ is malicious or benign. This involves investigating a PCAP file to understand the nature of the port scanning activity between internal systems.

### Skills Learned

- Examine network traffic to inspect packet capture files and identify source and destination IP addresses involved in the scanning.
- recognize patterns indicative of port scanning, such as multiple connection attempts to different ports from a single source IP address within a short time frame.
- Detect unusual behavior or deviations from expected network activity patterns that might suggest malicious intent.
- Develop the ability to recognize and evaluate various tools and methods used for network reconnaissance and port scanning.
- 
- Providing a clear and detailed explanation of the port scanning activity, including its nature and potential risks.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Wireshark used to analyze and visualize the behavior and information of captured packets, helping to detect the involved addresses and the type of traffic present on the network.
